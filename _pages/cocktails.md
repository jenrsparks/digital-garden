## Motivation

The book [Cocktail Codex: Fundamentals, Formulas, Evolutions](https://www.amazon.com/Cocktail-Codex-Fundamentals-Formulas-Evolutions/dp/160774970X) is arguably my favorite cocktail book, to the extent that I've gifted copies of it to fellow cocktail enthusiasts. It's changed how I approach cocktails, both my enjoyment and creation of them.
