_I'm not sure how you find a recipe with this name on a website with a tagline of "for discerning drinkers," but here we are, I suppose. I cringe at the name, and anytime I go to make it, I sense myself regressing to the twenty-somethings at the bar giggling to the bar tender._

_Even so, this drink is damn good. Arguably, it's probably a favorite; in the hypothetical oddly-specific kitchen fire, this would be one of the rescued recipes, leaving the family mac-n-casserole recipe to smolder. (That really was a bit of a stretch.)_

## Ingredients

- One part each:
  - vodka
  - coffee liqueur
  - amaretto
  - irish cream liqueur
  - milk (or non-dairy milk)
  - cream, half & half, _or_ more milk

 ### Notes
 
 - 1/2 oz each will make a 3 oz drink.
 - Using almond baileys & almond milk has been a very complimentary combination._

## Instructions

1. Combine with ice in a shaker.
2. Shake, strain, & serve straight up.
