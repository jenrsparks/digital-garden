_This one has genuinely been helpful for my husband early on in a cold; he says it helps 'kill the germs,' even though we both know it doesn't work that way. For most of us, the whiskey isn't great for the immune system, so your mileage may vary._

## Ingredients

- 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 shot whiskey
- 1 cup of tea, preferably uncaffeinated

## Instructions

1. Place honey in cup first, then pour the hot tea over it.
2. Add juice and whiskey.
3. Stir and serve.
