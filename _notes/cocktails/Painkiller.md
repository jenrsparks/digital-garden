_I'm not sure a single person in my house likes coconut, so the coconut cream has been swapped for the richest milk we can find at the time. It might lose some of its creaminess compared to the coconut milk, but it's worth it to avoid the crinkled noses at the taste of coconut._

## Ingredients

- 3 oz pineapple juice
- 1 oz orange juice
- 2 oz dark rum
- 1 oz whole milk (or non-dairy milk)
- Nutmeg for garnish
- Pebble ice, optional

## Instructions

1. In a cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes, mix the pineapple juice, orange juice, milk, and rum. 
2. Shake for about 10 seconds.
3. Prepare a glass with crushed or pebble ice if desired.
4. Strain the drink from the shaker into the glass.
5. Garnish with some grated nutmeg.
