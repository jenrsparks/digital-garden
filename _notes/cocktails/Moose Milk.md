_I should probably point out that the original recipe from {{ source }} says "and/or" for the liquor, but I really like using all three at the specified ratios, so we just go in. It seems to fit the spirit of the original recipe anyway._

## Ingredients

### Single Serving

_Makes a 7¾ oz serving_

- 2 oz cold coffee
- 2 oz half & half
- 3 oz good vanilla ice cream
- ½ oz rum, whiskey, and vodka
- ¼ oz Kahlua
- Nutmeg or dark chocolate shavings, to garnish

### Batch

_makes 31 oz, or four 7¾ oz servings_

- 1 cup (8 oz) cold coffee
- 1 cup (8 oz) half & half
- 1.5 cups (12 oz) good vanilla ice cream
- ¼ cup (2 fluid ounces) rum, whiskey, and vodka
- 2 tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) Kahlua
- Nutmeg or dark chocolate shavings, to garnish


## Instructions

1. Dump all the ingredients (except the garnish) into a bowl and whisk maniacally.
2. Let it sit for a minute, so the ice cream melts.
3. Top the mixture with the nutmeg or dark chocolate shavings.
