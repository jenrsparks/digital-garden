## Ingredients

- 2 oz añejo or reposado tequila
- ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
- ¾ ounce honey syrup (recipe below)
- ½ ounce grand marnier
- lemon wheel for garnish

## Instructions

### Honey Syrup

_A quarter cup of honey & water each will make you enough syrup for roughly 6 drinks. Feel free to scale up or down, but note that it won't keep as long since the honey is watered down._

Combine equal parts hot water and honey in a glass and stir until the honey is fully dissolved.

### Main Drink

1. Rub around the rim of your glass with a lemon slice. If you want only a portion of the rim salted, limit the amount of rim coated in juice, as dry parts of the rim won't pick up salt.
2. Overturn and twist your glass in your margarita salt to coat it. 
2. Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker, then add a cup of ice and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
3. Pour into the glass with ice (either from the shaker or fresh ice).
4. Garnish with a lemon wheel.
