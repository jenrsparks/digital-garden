_The premise of a long island iced tea is equal parts hard liquor, cola, sweetener, and acid to cut. I'm sure this started with a recipe somewhere, but it rapidly evolved into our family favorite that fits perfectly in our glass pitcher. We typically make this to share with a group, though I've certainly been known to make myself a single when it's calling._
